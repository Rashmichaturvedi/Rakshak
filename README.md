This is my website on On spot Real time accident Information and Insurance claim system . ongoing project
The purpose of the project is to make a web portal information system in case of road accidents, traffic    
          information management, analysis and reporting etc. Also, the system is prone to increase the false positives 
because there is no filter in place to verify if an accident detected is a real accident or just false. Difficult in retrieving the report back for analysing purpose and time consuming.. The accident reporting form must be completed by handy and often leads to delays in report submission.
	Our system focuses on onspot accident information so that no victim has to suffer any delay.
	The system main aim is to claim insurance by real time verification process and make this work easy for nominee & user’s family.
	It reduces delay of accident reporting and makes even more easy  to claim Insurance.
   1:Real-time Accident Recognition and Emergency call
       Our system will start working as soon as any accident is reported on road through CCTV enabled system .A CCTV camera continuously records footage of the ongoing traffic. If any accident happens ,  the act will be recorded in the footage.  soon nearby ambulance will be called to safe the person.  Here our  system will work as the person behind this working process will create id of the victim as per his Vehicle’s number and store the footage of accident for further processing.
	Footage of the accident for reporting purposes captured  by CCTV enabled system
	Creation of id of victim on web portal 
	Storing the footage with this user’s created id.
        2 : Police verification status
The police will try to extract the number from the vehicle’s screen-shot captured from the CCTV footage and the verification process will start by them. The traffic police will be then coordinate with the Regional Transport Office (RTO) to find the details of the vehicle and its owner. This SMS will contain the time, date and location of the offense. On user’s request,the police simply will login to our system and by putting vehicle’s name  will then verify the process.
	Police arrival of the accident spot .
	On request of any  relative of user, the police has to verify this accident on web portal.
	This will decrease the victim’s family problem of going to station for verifying the report for insurance  claim purpose.
        3: Medical verification status:
	The medical authority simply has to upload any document of medical damage of victim
	Then it will verify the medical status. 
         4:  Insurance claim
When all the above process will be done , the nominee of victim will simply send this document to insurance company for further processing and at the end when everything is done the money or insurance claim will be send online to the account of nominee. 
	Reports will reach to insurance company
